This repository contains all the tasks I completed during the Deloitte Virtual Internship Program offered through Forage.
It includes case-based challenges that simulate real-life work at Deloitte, focusing on areas like data analysis, risk assessment, and business decision-making.

I used tools like Excel, Tableau, and more to perform these tasks and present insights clearly and effectively. Each task helped me better understand how large consulting firms handle data, identify business risks, and provide solutions to clients.

This project is a great reflection of my interest in analytics, consulting, and problem-solving. It also shows my ability to work independently, manage time, and deliver results in a virtual internship settin
